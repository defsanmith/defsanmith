## Software Development Engineer

I’m a Software Engineer who builds end-to-end, full-stack applications—shipping features from idea to production with a strong emphasis on clean, maintainable code.

Over the past four years, I’ve worked across the stack (frontend, backend, and DevOps) in environments that pushed me to learn quickly and prototype fast. I enjoy working with modern tools and frameworks, and I’m deliberate about engineering quality: thoughtful architecture, readable abstractions, and pragmatic trade-offs that keep teams moving.

Professionally, I led an agile team at ZedexInfo to deliver a major product framework, improving project delivery efficiency by 55% through better tooling and process. At CarDekho, I developed and shipped features for a high-traffic platform serving over 20,000 daily users, collaborating across teams to enhance retention, reliability, and performance. Most recently, I worked on a fintech product, building end-to-end services that help users browse and compare financial metrics across over 8,000 U.S. stocks. I also contribute to open-source on GitHub and value community-driven development and mentorship.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can own impactful features end-to-end, learn from strong mentors, and apply my skills to new problem spaces. If you’re building product-focused software and care about high-quality execution, I’d love to connect.
